### Linguistic-based Data Augmentation Approach for Offensive Language Detection

In this paper, we propose a simple way to pass borders of traditional text data augmentation methods. Machine learning and deep learning are compared using [SVM](https://github.com/toygarr/lingda/blob/main/Codes/svm.ipynb) and [CNN-BiLSTM](https://github.com/toygarr/lingda/blob/main/Codes/berturk_cnn_bilstm.ipynb) model pipeline. Moreover, it includes the comparison of statistical and contextual methods, Word2Vec and BERTurk respectively. Also, normalization effects are investigated using Zemberek [codes](https://github.com/toygarr/lingda/tree/main/Codes/normalization).



[Codes](https://github.com/toygarr/lingda/tree/main/Codes) folder provides the task related codes. <br/>
[Dataset](https://github.com/toygarr/lingda/tree/main/Dataset) folder includes the description of the proposed dataset. <br/>
[Figures](https://github.com/toygarr/lingda/tree/main/Figures) folder contains representation of dataset gathering process and illustration of BERTurk-CNN-BiLSTM model pipeline. <br/>
